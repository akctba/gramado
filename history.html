            <h3>Lago Negro</h3>
            Lago Negro (Black Lake) is the most known, visited green area of Gramado. It was created[5] in 1953 by Leopoldo Rosenfeld on an area it was the biggest woods of the Hydrangeas
            ' Region, this very area had been destroyed by fire in 1942. It was named after Good Rest Valley (Vale do Bom Retiro) before fire.
            A creek was dammed up to create[6] a U-shaped lake. Rosenfeld imported pine seedlings from Black Forest in Germany to be planted all around the newly formed lake's rim.
            Lago Negro is a mile away from Town Hall. There is a boathouse, working daily from 8:30 AM to 7:00 PM, concession stands and a small craftsmen fair nearby.</td>
