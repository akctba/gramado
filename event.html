                Officialized by the National Cinema Institute (Instituto Nacional de Cinema - INC) in January 1973, the Gramado Film Festival was originally launched at the Hydrangeas Festivity (Festa das HortÃªnsias), where film exhibitions were promoted between 1969 and 1971. The efforts of the artistic community, the press, tourists and the locals made the initiative an official event. By the 1980s, it was already the most important film festival of Brazil. <br>
